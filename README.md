# alley-cat-with-pygame

This was a project for a Python class at Columbus State Community College. 

The game has music, soundeffects, and the cat can walk and jump with appropriate
animations.

In order to test the game, it uses an older version of PYGAME that is only compatible with
PYTHON 2.7 or equivalent.
